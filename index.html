            <p><em>San Diego, California.</em> 
            So, it all began for me there. That's where I was born and raised. 
            Taking my first step into the world was scary and exhilirating at the stame time. 
            I didn't know if I was going to fall flat on my face or take off running. Well I guess I took off running, 
            because that's still one of the things I love to do today. 
            Running was a great way to explore my surroundings, and San Diego was a great place to do that. 
            The weather was mostly sunny and breezy; perfect for getting outdoors. 
            I remember staying out for hours just playing with the neighborhood kids until dinnertime. 
            San Diego was a fun place for me to grow up. Other fun places I've been to are Colorado Springs, 
            Toronto, and Tokyo. All of them were great places to get out, take that first step and explore.

            <p><em>Iraq and Pakistan.</em> 
            Maybe it was the circumstances of why I was there that made it unpleasant and not so fun. 
            Being away from my family was tough. Also, there was danger everywhere, 
            so we always had to be on the lookout, especially on our missions. 
            There were many long days of flying missions that lasted throughout the night. 
            Flying at night should be peaceful, but it was far from relaxing. 
            All I will say is that I'm thankful for my teammates and for the success we had 
            working together to get it done. Every day, we all took that step into the unknown together.

            <p><em>Tacos de Lengua and Natto.</em> 
            Growing up in Southern California, I was introduced to many different types of mexican food. 
            This one in particular doesn't sound like it would taste good, but it actually works. 
            Maybe it's because the first time I tried it, I was pleasantly inebriated and 
            we stumbled across a late night taco truck in the alley behind the club. 
            But the combo of slow-cooked, fork-tender cow's tongue with simple toppings of 
            finely chopped fresh cilantro and onions, all cradled in a slightly charred corn tortilla, 
            is just magic on your taste buds. 
            Natto, on the other hand, is a karate punch to your senses. This one I tried completely sober while in Japan. 
            The smell, taste and texture will surprised me on all levels, and not in a good way. 
            It's a traditional Japanese breakfast item of fermented soybeans, and has a very
            pungent odor, a bold flavor and a slimy, sticky texture. Please, give it a go, if you are dare.

            <p><em>Dinuguan.</em> 
            You can search for it online. Basically it's pork blood stew with pig offal, such as 
            lungs, kidneys, intestines, ears, heart and snout. These lovely ingredients are simmered in pig's blood and 
            seasoned with garlic, chili and vinegar. Sounds yummy, right? I'll have to say that it's an acquired taste, 
            and I'm still acquiring it after all these years. It's definitely not my first choice of Filipino delicacies. 
            I'd much rather opt for pancit, chicken adobo or lumpia. But, I will say it's worth trying, 
            just to say you've tried it and survived.

            <p><em>Camaraderie at it's finest.</em> 
            I think the best times for me is when I feel the positive energy from 
            a group of people working towards a shared goal. This is what I experienced a few years ago as 
            part of the Air Force Cycling Team. We trained togther for months to ride across Iowa in their annual, 
            multi-day event called RAGBRAI. It stands for the Register's Annual Great Bike Ride Across Iowa. 
            The ride spans over seven days and approximately 450 miles and passes through many small towns along the way. 
            During this event, we helped other riders with flat tires and engaged in friendly conversations about 
            what we do in the Air Force. It was an enlightening experience that I will treasure for a long time. 
            I'm definitely glad I chose to be a part of this adventure.

        <h2 id="badTimes">Bad Times.</h2>
            <p><em>An unfortunate biking accident.</em> 
            As much as I love to bike, I hate injury even more. Especially when your ride is going so well. 
            It only takes a second to lose control, and then it's up to the laws of physics on how badly you get hurt. 
            In my case, it was bad, but could have been worse. I was cruising on my bike, 
            zipping along the trails at a pretty decent pace. It was really early, so there wasn't much light. 
            I was trying to squeeze in a quick ride before the kiddos woke up. As I recount the details of this story, 
            I realize that there were many causal factors leading up to the accident. 
            Realizing that I was having too much fun, I lost track of time and started to race back to my car. 
            Coming back towards the parking lot, I tried to take a shortcut. 
            Apparently this section of the path was closed, and I didn't notice it until 
            I was within a few feet of the metal chain hanging across the path. It was too late. 
            I slammed on my brakes and skidded right into the chain, flipped over my bike and crashed onto the pavement. 
            I must have landed on my shoulders and back somehow and not my head. I was knocked out for a good while. 
            Finally I slowly got up, making sure I wasn't in serious pain and called my wife for help. 
            Long story short, don't rush a good time. I'm definitely thankful to have survived that unfortunate misstep.

            <p><em>The really good ones got your back.</em> 
            It's definitely good to have people you can count on during your journey through life. 
            Whether it's a close friend or family, you know you can trust them to 
            give you sound advice and keep you clear of danger. I know I can always count on my wife. 
            She is always willing to listen and offer help. Sometimes I don't even have to ask. 
            She knows when I'm struggling and can offer a helping hand or just listen. 
            I'm really glad to have her in my life. I can trust her and count on her to 
            keep me moving forward on the right path.

        <h2 id="worstEnemy">My Worst Enemy.</h2>
            <p><em>Who's that guy in the mirror?</em> 
            You might be staring at them right now. It's no secret that you can be your own worst enemy. 
            Self-doubt and fear of the unknown can cripple us to the point of inaction and giving up. 
            But please don't let that happen. This is when we need to realize that we can affect 
            positive change in our lives. We must shove that negativity aside and focus on the 
            positive aspects of the situation. Then we will be able to move forward and learn from 
            this experience. I remember experiencing doubt and failure during my pilot training.
            I honestly did not think I was going to make it through. I questioned my abilities and my future, 
            especially after a bad training ride. What kept me going forward was the fact that there were 
            many who supported me and wanted me to succeed. I reflected on my previous accomplishments to 
            give me confidence. I had made it this far, and I was not about to quit. 
            Finally, I believed in myself and what I could do. This is what I needed to push forward.

            <p><em>Adventures in coding?</em>
            Sounds good. Let's give it a go! I'm truly excited about starting this next adventure. 
            I believe that I can do very well in coding and help make the world a better place. 
            I think the best part about life's journey is that it's up to you. 
            You decide when and where to take that first step. Even though you can't predict the future, 
            you can definitely steer yourself towards those future goals. And if things change a bit, 
            then that's okay. Because you're still alive and still running.

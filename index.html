            <p><em>San Diego, California - </em> 
            So, it all began for me there. That's where I was born and raised. 
            Taking my first step into the world was scary and exhilirating at the same time. 
            I didn't know if I was going to fall flat on my face or take off running. Well I guess I took off running, 
            because that's still one of the things I love to do today. 
            Running was a great way to explore my surroundings, and San Diego was a great place to do that. 
            The weather was mostly sunny and breezy; perfect for getting outdoors. 
            I remember staying out for hours just playing with the neighborhood kids until dinnertime. 
            San Diego was a fun place for me to grow up. Other fun places I've been to are Colorado Springs, 
            Toronto, and Tokyo. All of them were great places to get out, take that first step and explore.

            <p><em>Iraq and Pakistan - </em> 
            Maybe it was the circumstances of why I was there that made it unpleasant and not so fun. 
            Being away from my family was tough. Also, there was danger everywhere, 
            so we always had to be on the lookout, especially on our missions. 
            There were many long days of flying missions that lasted throughout the night. 
            Flying at night should be peaceful, but it was far from relaxing. 
            All I will say is that I'm thankful for my teammates and for the success we had 
            working together to get the mission done. Every day, we all took that step into the unknown together.

            <p><em>Tacos de Lengua and Natto - </em> 
            Growing up in Southern California, I was introduced to many different types of Mexican food. 
            This one in particular doesn't sound like it would taste good, but it actually works. 
            The combo of slow-cooked, fork-tender cow's tongue with simple toppings of 
            finely chopped fresh cilantro and onions, all cradled in a slightly charred corn tortilla, 
            is just magic on your taste buds. 
            Natto, on the other hand, is a karate kick to your senses. This one I tried while I was living in Japan. 
            The smell, taste and texture surprised me on all levels, and not in a good way. 
            It's a traditional Japanese breakfast item of fermented soybeans, and has a pungent odor, 
            a bold flavor and a slimy, sticky texture. Step up to the plate and give it a try...if you dare.

            <p><em>Dinuguan - </em> 
            It's pronounced "din-uh-Gwan" and enticingly nicknamed "chocolate meat". But don't let the name fool you.
            It's dark chocolate appearance comes from a most unusual ingredient. Dinuguan is pork blood stew with 
            pig offal, such as lungs, kidneys, intestines, ears, heart and snout. These lovely ingredients are 
            simmered in pig's blood and seasoned with garlic, chili and vinegar. Sounds yummy, right? 
            I'll have to say that it's an acquired taste, and I'm still acquiring it after all these years. 
            It's definitely not my first choice of Filipino delicacies. I'd much rather opt for pancit, 
            chicken adobo or lumpia. But, I will say it's worth it to step out of your comfort zone and try something different.

            <p><em>Camaraderie at it's finest - </em> 
            Speaking of stepping out of your comfort zone, joining an elite team of military athletes was probably 
            the last thing I thought I would do. But, I'm glad I did. As a member of the Air Force Cycling Team, 
            I was able to share in the happiness (and pain) during training, as we worked together towards a 
            common goal: to represent the Air Force at RAGBRAI, the Register's Annual Great Bike Ride Across Iowa. 
            This was a great experience that broadened my horizons. We trained together for months to ride across 
            Iowa in one of the most popular rides in the US. Drawing crowds of over 75,000 every year, this ride 
            spans over seven days and approximately 450 miles and passes through many small towns along the way. 
            During this event, we helped other riders with flat tires and engaged in friendly conversations about 
            what we do in the Air Force. It was an enlightening experience that I will treasure for a long time. 
            Just imagine if I hadn't taken that step into the unknown. I'm definitely glad I chose to be a part of 
            this adventure.

            <p><em>An unfortunate biking accident - </em> 
            As much as I love to bike, I hate injury even more. Especially when your ride is going so well. 
            It only takes a second to lose control, and then it's up to the laws of physics on how badly you get hurt. 
            In my case, it was bad, but could have been worse. I was cruising on my bike, 
            zipping along the trails at a pretty decent pace. It was really early, so there wasn't much light. 
            I was trying to squeeze in a quick ride before the kiddos woke up. As I recount the details of this story, 
            I realize that there were many causal factors leading up to the accident. 
            Realizing that I was having too much fun, I lost track of time and started to race back to my car. 
            Coming back towards the parking lot, I tried to take a shortcut. 
            Apparently this section of the path was closed, and I didn't notice it until 
            I was within a few feet of the metal chain hanging across the path. It was too late. 
            I slammed on my brakes and skidded right into the chain, flipped over my bike and crashed onto the pavement. 
            Somehow, I must have landed on my shoulders and back and not my head. I was knocked out for a good while. 
            Finally I slowly got up, making sure I wasn't in serious pain and called my wife for help. 
            Long story short, don't rush a good time. I'm definitely thankful to have survived that unfortunate misstep.

            <p><em>The really good ones got your back - </em> 
            It's definitely good to have people you can count on during your journey through life. 
            Whether they're a close friend or family member, you know you can trust them to 
            give you sound advice and keep you clear of danger. I know I can always count on my wife. 
            She is always willing to listen and offer help. Sometimes I don't even have to ask. 
            She knows when I'm struggling and can offer a helping hand or just listen. 
            I'm really glad to have her in my life. I can trust her and count on her to 
            keep me stepping forward on the right path.

        <h2 id="worstEnemy">My Worst Enemy</h2>
            <p><em>Who's that guy in the mirror? </em> 
            You might be staring at them right now. It's no secret that you can be your own worst enemy. 
            Self-doubt and fear of the unknown can cripple us to the point of inaction and giving up. 
            But please don't let that happen. This is when we need to realize that we can affect 
            positive change in our lives. We must shove that negativity aside and focus on the 
            positive aspects of the situation. Then we will be able to move forward and learn from 
            the experience. I remember experiencing doubt and failure during my pilot training.
            I honestly did not think I was going to make it through. I questioned my abilities and my future, 
            especially after a bad training ride. What kept me going forward was the fact that there were 
            many who supported me and wanted me to succeed. I reflected on my previous accomplishments to 
            give me confidence. I had made it this far, and I was not about to quit. 
            Finally, I believed in myself and what I could do. This is what I needed to push forward. 
            I mustered the courage to step over my obstacles and succeed.

            <p><em>Adventures in coding? </em>
            Sounds good. Let's give it a go! I'm truly excited about starting this next adventure. 
            I believe that I can do very well in coding and help make the world a better place. 
            I think the best part about life's journey is that it's up to you. 
            You decide when and where to take that first step. Even though you can't predict the future, 
            you can definitely steer yourself towards those future goals. And if things change a bit, 
            then that's okay. Because you're still alive and still running.
